### 1. **Set Up Your Go Environment**
- **Install Go:** Download and install Go from the official website.
- **Set Up Workspace:** Create a new directory for your project. Initialize a Go module using `go mod init <module-name>` to manage dependencies.

### 2. **Initialize Your Project with Cobra**
- **Install Cobra:** Use `go get github.com/spf13/cobra/cobra` to install the Cobra generator.
- **Initialize Cobra:** Run `cobra init` in your project directory. This will create a basic structure for your CLI application.

### 3. **Design the CLI Interface**
- **Define Commands:** Implement functions for each command (like `start`, `join`, `message`) using Cobra's command creation syntax. Each function should define what the command does.
- **Argument Parsing:** Use Cobra's built-in support for arguments and flags to parse and handle command-line inputs.

### 4. **Implement Real-time Messaging Functionality**
- **Choose a Communication Protocol:** Decide on WebSockets for real-time communication.
- **Server-Client Architecture:** Design the chat system with a central server and multiple clients.

### 5. **Create a Server for Handling Connections**
- **Setup a WebSocket Server:** Use the `gorilla/websocket` package to upgrade HTTP requests to WebSocket connections.
- **Manage Connections:** Create a map or a slice to track all active WebSocket connections. Implement functions to add and remove connections.

### 6. **Develop the Client Side**
- **WebSocket Client:** Utilize `gorilla/websocket` to establish WebSocket connections to the server.
- **User Interface:** Design a command-line interface for the client. For more advanced terminal UI, explore packages like `termui`.

### 7. **Implement Chat Functionalities**
- **Message Broadcasting:** Write a function on the server that iterates over all connected clients and sends messages to each of them.
- **Private Messaging:** Implement logic to target messages to specific clients based on identifiers.

### 8. **Handle Concurrent Connections**
- **Goroutines:** Use goroutines to handle multiple clients simultaneously. Each client connection should be handled in its own goroutine.
- **Channels:** Implement channels for communication between goroutines, especially for sending messages to the main goroutine managing client connections.

### 9. **Testing and Debugging**
- **Unit Tests:** Write tests for your functions and methods. Use Go's built-in `testing` package.
- **Debug:** Utilize Go's debugging tools, like delve, to troubleshoot and fix issues.

### 10. **Documentation and Deployment**
- **Document:** Write README files and code comments to explain how your application works.
- **Build and Deploy:** Use `go build` to compile your application. Consider deploying your server on a cloud platform if needed.

### Key Technologies and Techniques:
- **Cobra** for building the CLI.
- **Gorilla WebSocket** for WebSocket communication.
- **Concurrency Management:** Use goroutines and channels effectively.
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling throughout your application.
- **Modular Code:** Keep your codebase organized and modular for easier maintenance and updates.
