### Main Components

1. **`cmd/`**: Contains the command line interface setup using CobraCLI. Here, you define your `root.go` that sets up the CLI environment and `chat.go` where the chat command and its flags are defined.

2. **`internal/`**:
   - **`server/`**: Holds the server logic, including managing WebSocket connections (`server.go`) and handling connected clients (`client.go`).
   - **`client/`**: Manages the chat client functionality, establishing WebSocket connections and rendering the user interface in the terminal (`ui.go`).

3. **`pkg/`**:
   - **`websocket/`**: Utilities to handle WebSocket operations, such as message encoding and decoding.
   - **`common/`**: Defines common data structures used across the application, like message formats.

4. **`main.go`**: The entry point of your application, responsible for initializing and running the Cobra commands.

This structure keeps the server and client code separate, allowing you to manage each part of the application more easily. Additionally, using packages like `websocket` and `common` helps in maintaining a clean codebase by segregating functionality and reusable components.
