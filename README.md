### Tech Stack

1. **Programming Language**: Golang

   - For building the main application logic and handling server-client communication.

2. **CLI Framework**: CobraCLI

   - For creating the command line interface that initiates the chat client.

3. **Networking**: Gorilla WebSocket

   - A Go package that provides a complete and tested implementation of the WebSocket protocol.

4. **Data Handling**: JSON

   - For message formatting and data exchange between clients and server.

5. **Logging**: Zap

   - A fast, structured, leveled logging framework for Go.

6. **Configuration Management**: Viper

   - Works well with Cobra for handling configuration files and environment variables.

7. **Testing**: Go Testing Framework

   - For unit and integration testing of your Go code.

8. **Version Control**: Git

   - For source code management.

9. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: GitHub Actions
   - For automating builds, tests, and deployments.

### Roadmap

#### Milestone 1: Project Setup

- Set up the Go environment and project structure.
- Initialize Git repository and branch strategy.
- Set up CobraCLI with a basic command (`codechat --init`).

#### Milestone 2: Server and WebSocket Implementation

- Develop the WebSocket server using Gorilla WebSocket.
- Implement basic connect, disconnect, and message handling capabilities.
- Set up JSON for message formatting (e.g., sending, receiving messages).

#### Milestone 3: CLI Client Development

- Implement WebSocket client logic in the CLI application.
- Enable sending and receiving messages through the CLI.
- Integrate Cobra commands for different operations (e.g., send message, view messages).

#### Milestone 4: Testing and Debugging

- Write unit tests for both server and client components.
- Conduct integration testing to ensure the system works as a whole.

#### Milestone 5: Configuration and Logging

- Configure Viper to manage environment variables and configuration settings.
- Set up Zap for structured logging on both server and client sides.

#### Milestone 6: Deployment and CI/CD Setup

- Prepare Docker containers for deploying the server.
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

#### Milestone 7: Documentation and Cleanup

- Document the setup process, usage, and configuration options.
- Clean up the code, remove unnecessary parts, and ensure coding standards.

#### Mileilestone 8: Launch and Feedback Collection

- Launch the application for users.
- Collect feedback and make necessary adjustments based on user input.
