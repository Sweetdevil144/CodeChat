I apologize for the confusion. Here's a Development README designed to guide you from the very beginning of building your CLI chat application in Go. This document will help you set up your project, outline each step, and guide you through the development process.

# Development README for CLI Chat Application

Welcome to the development guide for building a CLI Chat Application in Go. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your development environment, structure your project, and develop the application step-by-step.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Go (1.15 or later): Download and install from [Go's official website](https://golang.org/dl/).

## Initializing Your Project

1. **Create a new directory for your project:**
   ```bash
   mkdir my-chat-app
   cd my-chat-app
   
2. **Initialize a new Go module:**
   ```bash
   go mod init my-chat-app
   ```

3. **Install Cobra for CLI command handling:**
   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra/cobra
   ```

   After installation, initialize Cobra:
   ```bash
   cobra init --pkg-name my-chat-app
   ```

## Project Structure

Organize your project with the following directory structure:

```
my-chat-app/
|-- cmd/
|   |-- root.go
|   |-- start.go
|-- pkg/
|   |-- server/
|   |   |-- server.go
|   |-- client/
|   |   |-- client.go
|   |-- chat/
|   |   |-- chat.go
|-- test/
|-- go.mod
|-- go.sum
|-- README.md
```

## Building the Server

1. **Develop the WebSocket server logic in `pkg/server/server.go`:**
    - Set up WebSocket connections.
    - Manage connected clients.
    - Broadcast messages to clients.

## Building the Client

1. **Handle client-side operations in `pkg/client/client.go`:**
    - Connect to the WebSocket server.
    - Send and receive messages.
    - Manage user inputs and outputs through the CLI.

## Implementing Core Functionalities

1. **Implement chat functionalities in `pkg/chat/chat.go`:**
    - Define message structures.
    - Handle messaging logic such as broadcasting and receiving.

## Testing and Debugging

1. **Write unit tests for both client and server components:**
    - Use Go's built-in `testing` framework.
    - Ensure all critical paths are covered.

2. **Debug your application:**
    - Use `go run .` to run your application for quick tests.
    - Use debugging tools like Delve for more complex issues.

## Documentation and Deployment

1. **Document your application:**
    - Update the README.md with user instructions and project details.
    - Comment your code clearly and concisely.

2. **Build and deploy:**
    - Use `go build .` to compile the application.
    - Distribute the binary or deploy on a server as needed.
