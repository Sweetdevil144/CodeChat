## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Go (1.15 or later): Download and install from [Go's official website](https://golang.org/dl/).

## Initializing Your Project

1. **Create a new directory for your project:**
   ```bash
   mkdir CodeChat
   cd CodeChat
   
2. **Initialize a new Go module:**
   ```bash
   go mod init CodeChat
   ```

3. **Install Cobra for CLI command handling:**
   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra/cobra
   ```

   After installation, initialize Cobra:
   ```bash
   cobra init --pkg-name CodeChat
   ```


## Building the Server

1. **Develop the WebSocket server logic in `pkg/server/server.go`:**
    - Set up WebSocket connections.
    - Manage connected clients.
    - Broadcast messages to clients.

## Building the Client

1. **Handle client-side operations in `pkg/client/client.go`:**
    - Connect to the WebSocket server.
    - Send and receive messages.
    - Manage user inputs and outputs through the CLI.

## Implementing Core Functionalities

1. **Implement chat functionalities in `pkg/chat/chat.go`:**
    - Define message structures.
    - Handle messaging logic such as broadcasting and receiving.

## Testing and Debugging

1. **Write unit tests for both client and server components:**
    - Use Go's built-in `testing` framework.
    - Ensure all critical paths are covered.

2. **Debug your application:**
    - Use `go run .` to run your application for quick tests.
    - Use debugging tools like Delve for more complex issues.

## Documentation and Deployment

1. **Document your application:**
    - Update the README.md with user instructions and project details.
    - Comment your code clearly and concisely.

2. **Build and deploy:**
    - Use `go build .` to compile the application.
    - Distribute the binary or deploy on a server as needed.
